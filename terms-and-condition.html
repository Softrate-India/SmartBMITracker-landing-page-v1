                        The Maximalist app stores and processes personal data that
                        you have provided to us, to provide our
                        Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and
                        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                        official operating system of your device. It could make your

                        compromise your phone's security features and it could mean
                        that the Maximalist app won't work properly or at all.

                        You should be aware that there are certain things that
                        Softrate India will not take responsibility for. Certain
                        functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                        by your mobile network provider, but Softrate India
                        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                        functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't
                        have any of your data allowance left.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="animated animatedFadeInRight fadeInRight">
                        If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                        should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                        other third-party charges. In using the app, you're accepting
                        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're
                        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

                        Along the same lines, Softrate India cannot always take
                        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                        make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of
                        battery and you can't turn it on to avail the Service,
                        Softrate India cannot accept responsibility.

                        With respect to Softrate India's responsibility for your
                        use of the app, when you're using the app, it's important to
                        bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                        to you. Softrate India accepts no liability for any
                        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

                    <p class="animated animatedFadeInRight fadeInRight">
                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                        currently available on Android - the requirements for the
                        system(and for any additional systems we
                        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                        and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                        using the app. Softrate India does not promise that it
                        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                        and/or works with the Android version that you have
                        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                        from your device.
